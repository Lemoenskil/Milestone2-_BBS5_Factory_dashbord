# Energy Factory BB55 Milestone 2
## Eneryg monitor Dashboard
By Yvett Smith

This Dashboard will be used mainly by a owner of solar pannels. To have an overwiew of the monthly, daily enery that was produced by the solor pannels. 

The user will also be able to do inspection on usaged and production and will have and idea what is the impact of the sunpower forcast on the production.

## UX
This Dashboard if for a home solar panel owner.  The owner will use this dashbord to get an overview of the production on the historical data   



### Strategy plane

#### Create a website for a Engineering Consulting Company bSentient
    
Build  Interactive Dashboard for a Home solar panel installation. 

The Dashboard has the following requirements:
    • Their primary target audiences are owners or prospective owners of Solar Home Installation
    • The Dashboard need to include the following 
	-installation address and location.
	-installation summery
	-Totals for carbon avoided and Euro earned
	-Graphs that show the daily and monthly and yearly production in kWh.
	-Graph that show the monthly usage compare to production
	-Heat map showing sun power weather data for on the Netherlands
	-Line Graph showing the sun power over the location of the solar installation.
	-Scatterplot showing the correlation between sun energy and power production
	
    • I need the following for the dashboard
	-photo of the installation
	-Summery of the installation
	-data file of kWh produced
	-Data of consumed energy
	-information on tariff and carbon avoided
	-Weather data (knmi)
    • Need a selector to choose the year and one to choose between euro and kWh
    • A map is also need to show the installation location

#### User stories:
Stories:
•	As a user, I'd like to see clean, well presented data in easy to understand/read format (graphs, charts, etc…)
•	As a user, I'd like to see a variety of charts/graphs to show different data in the dataset
•	As a user, I’d like for the dashboard to be made so that it will work and adapt to all manner of devices (responsive design)
•	As a user, I'd like to see some text to explain the data/statistics being seen on screen, giving further knowledge/context to the data being displayed
•	As a user, I'd like to see engaging use of colour making the dashboard pleasant to look at and keeping the user interested
•	As a user, I'd like to see easy to read font format for both the title/heading and all other writing on the dashboard
•	As a user, I'd like to be able to see the difference between kWh, Euro’s
•	As a user, I’d like to be able to have an overview of day, month and year data
•	As a user I’d like to be to compare data from the weather with my solor production
•	As a user, I'd like to be able to reset all the filters placed through clicks on the graphs with a simple button (therefore reverting the data shown on the graphs back to the default data)

#### Putting it all in the strategy plane

Project Purpose
I am creating a Data dashboard aimed towards helping current and prospective home solar panel installation owner getting an overview of their production, yield, carbon avoided  and cost.
The data dashboard will use both D3, leaflet and DC to plot multiple charts that will focus on different aspects of the dataset that I am using. The information I will mainly focus on is the energy/power production per day month and year.  I will only include the data from the date of installation from 19 September.   The usage date will be from Jan 2019.   
The dashboard will also include google map api. Whith the date from the weat 'knmi Dutch weathe' a  correlation map between the energy and sun power will be ploted
Why would a user want this?
In the current state of global warming solar power is a hot topic.  The user will not only want to save the planet but also want to see what is in it for him, and that will be financially.   Also as a user is would be nice to have a look as historical weather data do see what the correlation is between the weather and the production will be.
The user will also want it to get a one page overview in of his current production vs usage this can help in decisions for example extending the capacity of using the current capacity better.  (example if you want to move from the gas supply to only electrical)
Why is this so special?
The Data dashboard will stand out as it will have graphs that are easy to read and comprehend, and these will present the dataset in a way that provides the user with all of the required information,.
User Experience
There will be clean, well presented data in easy to understand/read format (graphs, charts, etc…), this will be the main draw to the dashboard.
The dashboard will also have responsive design, so it can display correctly on mobile devices, right through to large desktops, therefore allowing the information to be accessed and viewed properly no matter where you are or what device you are using.
There will also be summaries with some text included on the page to explain the data/statistics being seen on screen, giving further knowledge/context to the data being displayed.

    
### Scope Plane
    What they say they need
    • A Dashboard.
    • View their historical data
    • See profit made
    • Show that they are contrubuting to geener future

    What they actually need
    • Response Dashboard.
    • That can be viewed on a mobile.
    • Gives totals on montly, yearly and daily 
    

### Structure Plane

Information Architecture
Will be a simple tree structure using a horizontal bar near the top of the page taking up the right        two thirds of the page.
Interaction Design (IXD)
    • The Navbar will have the name of the istalation and a logo
    • For the color schem a bootwatch slate will be used.
    • One page sectins  will be used with a grid to it.
    • There will be a footer at the end that redirect you back to the top
    
### Skeleton Plane

#### mock-ups:

In the links below you can see the mock-up’s that I drew using the mock-up tool “Balsamiq”:
![Desk top mockup](/assets/mobile_wireframe.JPG)
![Mobile mockup](assets/desktop_wireframe.JPG)
- 
**Note that the final design has changed from the original design in the mock-ups. The reason why it has changed.  I was trying different layouts while I was experimenting and learning the code and sometimes the new designs looked better than the original ones, or was just more responsive. *
#### Design Ideas
The layout and the design of the dashboard, will be devided into blocks to give a  professional and of a high standard look. I broke the design down into various style decisions:

##### Font
I will be using “Roboto” that comes with the bootwatch template.

##### Colour Scheme
I am using the “Sandstone” theme from Bootswatch

The navbar for the solar production graphs has been test and the sizing has been change to fit better on the small mobile
-intial year will be 2019. that work and also selecting 2018 works but when you have selected on the graph you can not use this filter before resetting it  
-Euro value or kwh value for the 4 graphs. Was tested and work and the y axis label change to Euro.

- Solor panel monitor graphs
-Testing on small mobile i had to add the scroll bar, which was not needed for the rest
-Tested the 3 Bar charts for yearly, monthy and daily data.  The reset buttons where functional and and separete cliking on the bars worked.
-Line chart that show the hourly production with reset and brush worked.

- Usage vs production graphs
-Bar chart with a selector to choose year, and the reset function has been tested
-and the selection has been tested that only that the group empty of when selection a new bar.
-A scroll bar was added for responsiveness

-Test interactiveness with graph and heatmap


- Footer
Test the reset button and update colors and font




### Additional testing
Used development tools in Google Chrome to check how the website would look in different devices. Also used it to try different style and ideas.   

### Problems and bugs:
-Have a problem on this that that do not space enought on the x-axis.    
-on the small mobile view i had to but in a scroll as the graph sgv was not responsive.
-the heat map player does not interact with the graph had to put in a total reset


## Deployment
This site is coded in Cloud9 IDE, a local Git directory was used for version control. It is hosted by using GitHub, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.  I have ran regular commits after every important update to the code, and I pushed the changes to GitHub pages.
Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://lemoenskil.github.io/Milestone2-_BBS5_Factory_dashbord//
