[Scope Plane](./user-design-experience/Scope_Plane/Scope_Plane.pdf)

### Structure Plane
see link to document
[Structure Plane](./user-design-experience/Structure_Plane/Structure_Plane.pdf)

Information Architecture
Will be a simple tree structure using a horizontal bar near the top of the page taking up the right        two thirds of the page.
Interaction Design (IXD)
    • Site Logo will bring user back to home as well as having ‘Home’ on the navigation bar in case
    some un-tech savvy users don’t know this convention.
    • Each Menu heading will have some sort of roll over to confirm that clicking that area has an
    action.
    • Each navigation button will have a particular colour, which will be used on its corresponding page
    to visually confirm what page they are on.
    o On mobile device the hamburger icon will be used.
    • The ‘Special offer for training and free first assessment’ information will be at the top of each
    page.
    o It will bring up a pop-up with a simple form that asks for their first name and last name
    and email address.
    o A radio button to choose what it will be e.g. training, development , consulting.
    o We will include that their email won’t be passed on to anyone else.
    o We will provide a message once they have successfully completed the form and hit the
    submit button.
    • The social links to Facebook, LinkedIn will have roll-over effects and open in a blank window.
    • On the landing page section there will be 5 blocks with a short description and if you click on it
    will take you to either to the product, service or training page
    • In the footer there will be links to about and Contact and Privacy statement, this will be on all
    the pages
    
    **see document for diagram: *
[Structure Plane](./user-design-experience/Structure_Plane/Structure_Plane.pdf)
    
**Note that on the final product there was some changes as the customer was not focused on the privacy statement as it s still working on that.  Also they did not need to see the pop up on each page.  Also they did not want different colour per page as it is not seemed fit for a professional company (and was looking more for background pictures to fit IOT and AI (artificial networks).They also wanted an criteria selection on the form as they need to know which field of technology the customer was interested in.   They wanted the social media logo as they are going to us it in the future*


### Skeleton Plane

#### mock-ups:

In the links below you can see the mock-up’s that I drew using the mock-up tool “Balsamiq”:
![Desk top mockup](./user-design-experience/Skeleton_Plane/Desk_Top_Mockup.jpg)
![Mobile mockup](./user-design-experience/Skeleton_Plane/Mobile_mockup.jpg)
- 
**Note that the final design has changed from the original design in the mock-ups. The reason why it has changed.  I was trying different layouts while I was experimenting and learning the code and sometimes the new designs looked better than the original ones, or was just more responsive. In the desktop design the block with information was not that dominant which I have changed.   Made it bigger and put is on the background picture with a carousel.   Also have I cantered the Main information block and added a modal with a button.  On the mobile design I have added no picture and have just made use of the info block and made sure the button was visible for the user.  I have also replaced the logo at the footer and put the links for contact and social media*

## Deployment
This site is coded in Cloud9 IDE, a local Git directory was used for version control. It is hosted by using GitHub, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.  I have ran regular commits after every important update to the code, and I pushed the changes to GitHub pages.
Once in a GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: https://github.com/Lemoenskil/milestoneoneproject/
